## About the Project

This project is part of the coursework for the Operating Systems Design class at department of Information and Electronic Systems Engineering of the International Hellenic University. It involves implementing a process scheduler using a priority queue. In this scheduling system, processes are sorted based on their priority, and in cases where multiple processes have the same priority, a round-robin scheduling algorithm is applied.
